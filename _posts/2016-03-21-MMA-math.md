MMA math is the idea that: Fighter A beat Fighter B and Fighter B beat Fighter C
therefore Fighter A can beat Fighter C. This is of course, complete nonsense and so
I made a site to prove it. With mma-math.com you can pick any 2 finders and see if
there's an MMA math path between them.  

## Backend Implementation
Using Node.js  and cheerio (a node jquery implementation) I scraped the data from ESPN and put it into a Neo4j graph db with the fighters as nodes and the wins as edges. Once the data was in the database the cypher query lang makes it extremely easy to find a path between two nodes as all it requires is the following query.
```
match (winner:Fighter {fighterID:{winnerID} })
match (loser:Fighter {fighterID:{loserID}})
optional match path=shortestPath((winner)-[:Beat*..100]->(loser))'
return winner, loser, path
```
So I was able to write an REST endpoint `/paths` which takes a `winnerID` and a `loserID`
as params to return a back a json. For example here's the json returned for the
MMA math path that "proves" Georges St-Pierre > Anderson Silva
```json

The trickier part ended up being figuring out how a user friendly way to pick two fighters
to compare. With 16,000 fighters a classic drop down wouldn't do much good so I decided on an
autocomplete solution. I ended up using the [typeahad.js](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) library by twitter. Typeahead.js pulls the autocomplete data from two places, a local and remote data source.
For the local data source you can simply give a feed it a list of  objects and tell it which property
to do the auto prediction on using one of the autocomplete engines that are bundled with the library.
For the local data I figured I wanted a list of current UFC fighters since the
UFC is the most popular promotion. So I wrote a scraper to scrape wikipedia page of the
[current ufc roster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_UFC_fighters?oldformat=true) and return a list of names. Then comparing the list of names in the UFC from a data dump of all the fighters I wrote to a
ufcFighters a list of objects with the information to be displayed.
e.g.  
```js
[{img:"cormier.png", fighterID:789, name:"Daniel Cormier", nickname:"DC"},
{img:"barnett.png", fighterID: 123 name:"Josh Barnett", nickname:"The WarMaster"}]
```

For the remote data I had to make my own autocomplete api deciding I wanted to use a [trie](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Trie).
I found the handy node library [triecomplete by klewfirst](https://www.npmjs.com/package/triecomplete).
At first I just loaded the trie with the keys as the fighter full names and the values as
the as an object that contained the data the needed to be displayed. So the trie with the single fighter with the name Foo would look like this:
![Initial Trie](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4913202/18603121/d1e58fea-7c23-11e6-983d-362425799b5b.png)

 This worked but I found to be suboptimal because there are a large subset of fighters
that are known better by either their nickname or just their last name. For example most MMA fans will
say Shogun instead of Maurcio Rua or Lesnar before they would say Brock Lesnar. So I made it keys of the trie was not only the full name but the last name (defined as the last space delimited word of the full name) and the nickname. So a trie with a fighter with the name `"Ba r"`,  nickname `"Goo"` would look like this.
Note: I ignored "the" when loading nicknames into the trie as it would clutter the autocomplete results, and with a few exceptions, if you're not Bruce Buffer,  you normally don't say the "the" part of the nickname when referring to a fighter.


![Second Trie](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4913202/18603503/ecc82400-7c26-11e6-8c32-330740907626.png)

This lead me to discover 2 problems:

1) There are many fighters with the same name, last name, or nickname. I probably should've caught this
sooner as there are some fighters with the same full name. But the last name and nickname sharing were much more common. Which while we're on the topic, if you're an aspiring professional fighter don't call yourself Pitbull
there's already 10 and one of those is Andrei fucking Arvloski.
Anyways what was happening was that whoever was last in the scraping list would be the only fighter that was loaded into the trie would be the only one that would show up. The way I caught this was Anderson "The Spider" Silva who held a 2,457 day long middleweight title reign wasn't showing up in favor of Anderson "Banana" Silva a fighter with a 1-2 record. So to fix this instead of storing just one object as the value it would be a list of objects. So a trie with a two fighters with the name `"Ga R"` and no nickname would look like this:
![Third Trie](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4913202/18604019/542e7680-7c2c-11e6-8c9d-276a012a8b9d.png)

2) Now that fighters are values for multiple keys it is possible that they will show up more than once in the
search results. Fix was a pretty straightforward dedup method.
```js
function dedupFighters(fighterList){
    var dedupedArr = [];
    var seenIDs = {};
    fighterList.forEach(el=>{
        if(!seenIDs[el.fighterID]){
            dedupedArr.push(el);
            seenIDs[el.fighterID] = true;
        }
    });
    return dedupedArr;
}
```
With the bugs squashed I was then able to make a `fighters/search` with the param `q` endpoint which
the typeahead library would be able to call as the user typed in characters into the search box.

## Frontend Implementation
Typeahead.js is a jquery library and since this is such a small site I stuck with vanilla js and jquery.
It was all pretty much straight forward ajax queries and dom manipulation. The only tricky part was
getting the typeahead js library to play nice with wonderful [natural language form by Mary Lou](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/05/21/natural-language-form-with-custom-input-elements/) but that was
still some relatively minor css adjustments.
