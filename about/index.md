## Developer
I started coding at the University of Oregon when I added computer science as a second major to my original major of physics. I quickly discovered I was much more interested in computer science and dropped
physics major down to minor. During the summer of 2014 I worked an internship at Electric Cloud
where I worked on [Huddle](https://electric-cloud.com/products/electricaccelerator/huddle/): a peer to peer build accelerator. After graduation I then worked with [RideCell](http://ridecell.com/) where I was on the core backend
team that launched [BMW Reachnow](http://www.bmwcarsharing.com/) in Seattle.

## Teacher
I've worked at roles that had a teaching component off and on since I was 13 from
theater camp counselor to volunteering in the community. Professionally I've
worked as a teacher's assistant at the [Moss Street Children's Center](http://moss.uoregon.edu/)
the [Co-op Family Center](http://coopfamilycenter.org/). I also have experience teaching computer
science as an Teacher for [thinkersmith](http://thinkersmith.org/), Instructor at [idTech](https://www.idtech.com/)
and TA for the University of Oregon's Intro to CS class. My favorite teaching memory is when I was at
the Co-op family center and I used some free time to teach basic python to the kids individually.
This one girl in particular got super into it. One day I covered nested lists and at the end of the day she
ran up to her mom and shouted.
 "MOM! DID YOU KNOW YOU COULD PUT LISTS....INSIDE OF LISTS!!???"

## Martial Artist
I started wrestling sophomore year of high school where I promptly lost all of my matches the first year.
But after a few years of putting in an extra hour after practice won 3rd in state my senior year.
I then trained brazillian jiu jitsu earning my [blue belt from 10th planet instructor Brent Alvarez](http://www.jj4all.com/10p/rank/). Currently I train [SAMBO](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sambo_(martial_art)) over at [FitFight training center](http://fitfightsf.com/fighting/).
